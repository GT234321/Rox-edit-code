# Rox-edit-code

This is a code editor with the ROX programming language, this language is just being developed, I am working on it alone.
It is easy to understand in it if you can make a window and add a color for the background.

# What programming looks like on it
```
var = createwindow # makes a window

window.screen(500, 500) # makes the size of the window
window.background('gold') # changes the background to any color
```
